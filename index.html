        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>Are humans inherently inclined towards violence and destruction? Deep within us lies an innate urge within, a remnant of our primitive ancestry, waiting to be awakened. Innate savagery is the raw, untamed aspect of humanity, often concealed beneath a veil of civilization, social norms, and morality. It represents the instinctual drive for survival, an urge for dominance, and a capacity for violence that lurks within all of us, ready to pounce in times of crisis or chaos. The exploration of the effects of innate savagery on our actions reveal the importance of the social norms that keep humanity civilized. While the concept of innate savagery suggests that humans have a tendency to make morally unethical decisions, our individual choices and backgrounds also significantly influence our behavior. This nuanced relationship between social norms and primal instincts illustrates the complexity of human nature.</p>

            <h2>Sophie</h2>
            <p>In contrast to Agatha, Sophie’s character development in <i>The School for Good and Evil</i> reveals that looks can be deceiving when it comes to one’s inner evil. From the start of the book, Sophie is depicted as the epitome of a princess. She is narcissistic about her appearance, longs for a fairy-tale ending, and does “months of good deeds” solely to prove that she’s good  (Chainani 12). However, as the story progresses, Sophie’s true nature begins to unravel, revealing a complex character with ulterior motives, ambition, and desire for power. Sophie’s actions grow manipulative and increasingly selfish, especially after Agatha gets placed in the School for Good while she ends up in the School for Evil. Sophie begins to do anything to tear Agatha and the man of her dreams, Tedros, apart, even going as far as hurting other people and breaking down the schools to achieve her goals. Her switch from superficial acts of kindness to her true evil nature display that inner goodness comes from within and can’t be judged from small acts or external appearances. Sophie’s transformation is a stark contrast to Agatha’s, demonstrating how innate savagery can unfold when one is faced with adversity or temptation.

            <h2>Agatha</h2>
            <p>Throughout <i>The School for Good and Evil</i>, Agatha’s drastic character arc underscores that one’s true nature isn’t defined from outward appearances but by one’s actions. Despite her unconventional preferences, such as tends to like “gloom and doom,” as well as “suffering and unhappiness,” Agatha exhibits genuine compassionate and kindness to her one friend, Sophie (Chainani 82). Agatha repeatedly faces ostracization from the princesses and princes for her differences and nonconformity to the superficial stereotypes of good, such as liking pink, being dumb, and being a bully. Yet Agatha remains true to her kind nature and constantly attempts to free Sophie from the School for Evil, especially since she thinks that Sophie is good and deserves a life of happiness. Nearing the end of the story, Agatha finally recognizes that she has been “beautiful all along” because of her inner goodness regardless of her darker appearance (Chainani 284). Agatha’s character arc  and high moral compass portray that the capacity for goodness or evil resides in one’s choice, rather than their outward characteristics or societal labels.
